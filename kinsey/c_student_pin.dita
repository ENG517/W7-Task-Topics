      <p>A Student Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a new additional security measure that will allow some university offices to ensure compliance with the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA.</p>
      <p>When helping students over the phone, this additional step will allow student services representatives and administrative officials to verify the identity of the caller by asking for the self-identified PIN that only the student should know.</p>
