# W8 Exercise - Identifying and Creating Concept Topics

**Objective**: Identify **concept** topic content on NCSU's Student Services website. Translate that content as concept topic `.dita` XML files.

## Workflow

1. Create a new branch with the following naming scheme: `lastname-concept-topic-exercise`.
2. In your personal work folder, create at least 3 new concept topic files based on the content at the Student Services page.

## What to Do

1. Review the following suite of pages from NCSU's Student Services:
  - ["Personal Information and Privacy"](https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/resources/personal-information-and-privacy/).
  - ["Student Addresses"](https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/resources/personal-information-and-privacy/student-addresses/)
2. In your respective work folder, create at least 3 concept topics to account for conceptual content across these pages.
3. Use the following filenaming scheme for your concept topic files: `c_variation_of_your_title.dita`.
  - **Examples**: `c_what_is_student_pin.dita`, `c_coffee_bean_grind_levels.dita`, or `c_benefits_of_preparing_coffee_beans.dita`
4. Before you start translating the concept topic content, feel free to copy an paste the content from the skeleton file for task topics in the root of this repo: `c_scary_skeleton.dita`.

## Identifying existing task content

Concepts often include the following information (Bellamy et al., p. 220):

- Does not have numbered lists
- Describes what something is or how it works (not how to do _it_)
- Might have bulletted lists
- Noun-based titles or headings, such as 
  - "Electric lawn mowers"
  - "Database security models"
  - "Nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source"

Be sure to review the Bellamy text to learn more about concept topics. And, watch my example video (on Moodle), where I go through the conversion process.
