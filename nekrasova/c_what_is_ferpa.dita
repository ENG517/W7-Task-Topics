  <title>What is FERPA?</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Under FERPA, students have the right to control the release of their directory information, which includes their name, address, enrollment status, and other personal details.</p>
    <p>At NC State, students can restrict or grant access to their directory information through the MyPack Portal by using privacy settings.</p>
    <p>A full privacy block can be requested to prevent any information from being shared, but this may affect participation in graduation and Dean's List publications.</p>
