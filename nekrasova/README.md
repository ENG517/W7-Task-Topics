# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
I created the task topic files based on the types of actions users would need to perform on the NC State Student Services pages. The reasoning behind creating individual task topics was to break down complex processes into smaller, user-friendly tasks.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
In translating the tasks from the website, I made adjustments to ensure that the instructions were simplified and followed a consistent, imperative tone. For example, instead of leaving the process open-ended with vague phrases, I converted them into step-by-step procedures with clear commands.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
One pain point was deciding how much information to include in each task topic. The original website content contained a lot of background information, such as descriptions of different address types, which were not necessarily part of the task execution.

## How did you overcome those pain points?
To overcome the issue of excessive information, I focused strictly on the actionable steps that users needed to complete.
