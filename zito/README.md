# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I divided the pages into four different task topics based on the webpage's contents. One major indicator was the number lists included on the pages. This told me that a new task topic needed to be created.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I did not make any major changes to the original task. Just some grammar and including imperative phrases for some steps. I also removed some content that did not fit within the steps/context of the task.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

Knowing the order of dita/xml was difficult and making sure the relationship between labels was correct. For example, knowing where the context tag can go. Also the formatting of the code felt off. I wasn't sure when to add an extra blank line to improve readability since many tags are nestled within each other.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

Rewatching the videos on Moodle a few times helped understand which tags are related and what is contained within those tags.
