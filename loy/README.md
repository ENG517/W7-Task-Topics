# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I looked for command verbs. If I could tell that the information was trying to convey a procedure or offer a series of steps that users must follow, I decided to create a task topic file for it. What was more tricky was determining if a certain step needed to be broken up into more than one task topic file. For example, if there were a set of steps inserted into a larger set of steps, I just went ahead and broke it up into two task files. This happened when I was writing task topics for restricting access to personal information in MyPack Portal. The set of steps regarding how to initiate a full privacy block seemed, to me, like it warranted its own task topic file apart from *just* restricting the information.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

For the most part, I kept everything the same, although I did alter some words to keep the phrase shorter or more direct in the commands users were being given with the instructions. I also pulled phrases to craft a better "short description" for each topic. I still used verbatim sentences from the website, but I rearranged them in a way that was more concise while still providing the needed contextual information. Every edit was done with the intention to make the task more simplified and readable for the user, while also allowing the topic to stand on its own and convey one clear idea to the user.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

I think, overall, this entire idea of writing task topic files makes sense, but the medium in which we're doing it is really tricky to grasp. It feels pretty abstract, and I am not used to writing in XML/HTML, so it's confusing trying to understand the logistics behind writing in those languages. I have a decent grasp at being able to break apart this information into concrete task topics/dividing things so that files only represent one idea or question for the user, but the act of actually writing that out is a little difficult for me at the moment.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I asked peers a lot of questions, and I referred back to the DITA learning lessons we did. It definitely helped to see examples of task topics already written out so that I knew when to indent and an example of how to nest certain elements inside of each other. I will definitely need to continue referring back to things like the readings/textbook and online resources moving forward, however.
