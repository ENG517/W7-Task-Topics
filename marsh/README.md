Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
Comparitavely to my peers, I added a task called "t_define_address_terms.dita" because I felt it was important to dedicate a task to teaching the audience the terms involved with the other tasks. The others involve: accessing privacy settings, updating adresses, and viewing personal information. The three other tasks are very important and require organization to help the audience work through specific tasks.
