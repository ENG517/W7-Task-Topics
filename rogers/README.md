# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I decided to divide "Add Address" and "Update Address" because it would make either of those easier for reuse, and had I not split them up, the proceedure would have exceeded 10 steps. I decided to split up "View personal information" and "Restrict personal information" because, again, it's better for resuse and too much information to combine. Also, someone might want to view their info but not necessarily restrict it. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

One change I made was to add action verbs into the MyPack pathways in the prereqs. Instead of using the arrow symbols, I added action words like "Go to" and "Click on" to the directions more reusable regardless of stylization. I also wasn't sure if the symbols would mess up DITA.

I also chose to leave out the "Note" for the Restrict Information proceedure because I wasn't sure if it was a prereq or result.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

One part I'm still unsure about it whether I should have included the address definitions in my code. It seems like too much information to be added to a task, but I also wasn't sure if I could make a new task for that info if wasn't going to have steps. Additionally, it was difficult to translate symbols and abide by the NCSU website style while still writing for reuse.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I overcame those painpoints by rewatching the videos and ultimately writing for reuse above trying to totally match the website.
