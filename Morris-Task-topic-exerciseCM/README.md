# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
I took great care in using simple tasks that had clear, short directions. This one helps me focus on the coding aspect and two, helps define what a good task should encompass. According the the readings, A DITA task topic provides step-by-step instructions to help the user complete a procedure. The structure of a task topic includes sections for the context, prerequisites, steps, expected results and additional details as needed. My content provides context, why it is useful, prereqs and steps tp complete the task. 


## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
My goal was to start with the simple tasks that had clear steps. This helped in buidling the content inside of Github. I did update the wording on some steps and kept the steps one directional. I did not include if this, then that type of content. It is purely how to do the tasks.


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
Nothing at this point caused major issues. Unless I am completely doing the process in GitHub wrong. Then I will have to regroup and redo. I am still at a point where I am not sure if I am doing this correctly so would not be surprised if I am doing it wrong. 


## How did you overcome those pain points?
Realizing if I am off course will help me learn how to better manage these concepts and skills in the future. This is a lot of using the resources, doing the tasks, coding the information to be comfortable with the process overall.
