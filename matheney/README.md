# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
I chose to create task topic files to reflect the tasks that were available on the websites. The headings on both pages describe the tasks below, which informed my decision to make task topics for each.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
I mostly faithfully translated the tasks from the original website, but in some places, I edited the procedure to better adhere with best practices for task writing.
For example, in the "Restrict Directory Information" task on the (website)[https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/resources/personal-information-and-privacy/], step 6 doesn't begin with an imperative verb. This isn't a major problem, but I still rewrote it in my task topic:

>Click the green <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> button to save your changes</cmd>

Step 6 now functions bettter as an actionable task for the user.
To fit DITA conventions, some steps were also broken up into "choices" elements. Step 5 on the same page was converted into a note rather than an outright step to signify that this is an optional step. 

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
Managing the elements was a difficulty, although not unmanageable. The process highlighted my novice status in task topics as I often left elements open, forgetting to close "steps" or "cmd" elements. I was also unsure about what all the elements were and what I should use when-- I don't really know the difference between "shortdesc" and "context" as elements in the task topic hierarchy.

## How did you overcome those pain points?
I overcame these pain points by researching the DITA specs and practicing my element-writing, or using the code editor to find closed elements (or lack thereof).
