# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
It really felt like there were only four places where you get definite task topics across the web pages. I did not want to create concept or reference topics since that was not the assignment so options were limited. I believe the topics I chose have enough within them to be there own topic and could be used to reassemble a larger project but not too big that they need to be split up. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
In my t_add_address and t_change_privacy_restrictions folders I deviated from the original format of the web pages. I created sub topics and explained some basic prereq's to better break up the information and create a even clearer picture of the desired goal. I tried to keep a lot of the original language or when I did change my language, tried to keep it in the same tone. Anytime I changed language was when I was changing format or trying to breakup a single step into logical substeps that would help the user see their choices better. 

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
My main pain points was understanding what tags needed to go into each other and how if you missed a step in the initial set-up of the dita folder, it could mess up your spacing and ability to close tags in the actual code line. I feel my task topics have spacing issues or indentation issues which could effect the layout later on. I feel like I am still having this issue but once I have some more practice and start understanding what needs to be contained in something and what does not, I will feel better using this code format. The actual writing of dita and piecing the dita process together through different tags started to make sense and felt easier as I moved through my procedure.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

Initially I tried to space out the indentation more and more so that my tags could eventually close correctly or my ends could line up with the start tags. I realized though that this was gonna probably have some bad spacing consequences later on and tried to rectify the issue by resetting my spacing and fixing where I had messed up in the beginning. A good example of this was not indenting my prereq tag under my taskbody tag. So I hope I can fix this habit early on and start thinking on this sort of organizational level involving grouping. It really just takes being careful in knowing where you are going or planning before just typing away and I believe that was one of my issues. I looked back at some of the practice material as well as looked at some online help to try to understand the structure more before just writing.
