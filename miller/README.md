# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

While going over the articles, I found it interesting there didn't seem like a clear divide between different types of topics. I tried to only apply the task framework to what was specified in the DITA learning courses. There had to be some type of task being done and steps on how to do it. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I translated most tasks word for word. For the t_view_personal_information file, I broke down the task into smaller steps (I did not repeat this for t_restrict_information because I thought it would be redundent).

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

My main pain points were identifying which type of topic is which and only using topic-specific coding guidelines. I had the urge to make the whole text a topic and that doesn't match how gradular DITA needs to be to be done corrrectly. 

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I found additional resources and vidoes to help me through my pain points (and read the instructions to the assignment at least four times). I saw you shared another resource that could help, so I'll look more into that for additional clarification.
