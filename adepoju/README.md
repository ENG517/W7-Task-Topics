# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I made specific task topics to help students easily find out how to manage their personal and address details on the MyPack Portal. Each topic covers only one activity, like adding or updating information, making it straightforward and easy to follow. This approach helps ensure that students can find exactly what they need without confusion.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I changed the website’s text to make it more direct and easier to follow. For example, instead of saying "you can log into your MyPack Portal," I changed it to "Log into your MyPack Portal." I also organized the information into clear steps.

Reasoning:

* Clear Instructions: Using direct commands makes it easier for students to know exactly what to do.
* Standard Format: Structuring the info into steps and commands helps fit the format that students are likely used to, making the instructions easier to use and more helpful.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

It was tricky to decide how much information to include in each step so it’s helpful but not overwhelming.
Then, there was the indentation/arrangement issue; it was a little difficult to nest the tags and place them in a way that was hiererchical and easier to follow.
## How did you overcome those pain points?

I built the topics step by step, starting with a basic outline and then adding more details to make sure everything was clear and correct.

For the arrangements, I looked at videos on what they should typically look like and replicated for my own task topic.
