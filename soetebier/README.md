# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preparation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
For the student addresses page, I created 2 task topic files. While on first glance, there appears to only be one procedure, it contained what I considered to be two different tasks:
    * Adding a new address
    * Updating an existing address
Thus, I split these two unique tasks into their own topic document.

I also created 2 task topics for the personal information page. The first was the most obvious task topic: changing privacy settings. This procedure stood out from the rest of the page because of its obvious formatting into steps. Less obvious was the coaching included for locating the student information page. I translated the included path into its own procedure. While a similarly formatted path was included in the student address's page, this was incorporated into the address procedures, so I felt it did not warrant its own task topic.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
As mentioned, I split the included procedure from the Student Addresses page into two different task topics, as I believed that the user goals differed enough to justify the splitting of the tasks.

Additionally, I removed the list of personal information, from my procedure on viewing personal information. This was done because I believe that content is better suited for a concept or reference topic, rather than a task. The list, while helpful, was not necessary to complete the task correctly.

Throughout my task topics, I altered the wording of various tasks to keep with the WTGA guidelines for coaching moves that we have been following throughout this course.


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
My major pain point came from following syntax. I had a habit of not including a closing tag for my elements. Additionally, I had some minor issues with assessing what information should be included in the task topic, and what should be added to hypothetical concept and reference topics.


## How did you overcome those pain points?
I got in the habit of writing my opening and closing tags before including any of my content. While this did slow my flow, and was a bit awkward, I found that I had significantly fewer errors this way.

To address the second pain point, I relied on the WTGA framework that was introduced in the last unit. I decided that the only information I needed to include were coaching moves, and the most necessary alerting moves. With this in mind, I was able to revise my existing task topics to remove the extraneous information.
